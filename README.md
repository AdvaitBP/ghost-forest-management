# ghost-forest-management

## objective

We want to evaluate different management strategies (thin-layer placement, living shorelines, salt-tolerant species introduction, hydrological barriers, etc.)

## geographic extent

Currently we are limiting our research to the Albemarle Peninsula, potentially divided by watersheds or management units for finer analysis

## time horizon

Historical Analysis: 1985 - present (to establish baselines for current analysis)
Future Scenarios: Next 10-20 years (to support decisions in the future about certain management strategies)

## choices

Effectiveness metric: We will use a combined approach incorporating both direct forest coverage to account for spacial extent as well as NVDI (vegetation index) to account for vegetation quality. We will use this to quantify ghost forest progression.
